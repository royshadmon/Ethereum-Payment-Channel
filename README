Project is still in early development and I wanted to just get things working, so please excuse the code messiness. 
The branch with the most features is roy/GambleOnChain. 

Install truffle
Node

To run locally:

git checkout roy/GambleOnChain

Terminal 1:
cd Ethereum-Payment-Channel/PaymentChannel
npm run dev

Terminal 2:
cd Ethereum-Payment-Channel/PaymentChannel
truffle develop 
migrate --reset
